/* The following set of Context/Specification pairs are in place to specify the functionality that you need to complete for the MovieLibrary class.
 * MovieLibrary is an collection of Movie. It exposes the ability to search,sort, and iterate over all of the movies that it contains.
 * The current implementation of MovieLibrary has almost all of its methods throwing a NotImplementedException. Your job is to get all of the Contexts and their
 * accompanying specifications [tests] passing
 * 
 * This exercise will give you an opportunity to get some familiarity with the following contracts:
 * 
 *      -IEnumerable<T> - The Grandfather of all collection interfaces
 *      -IList<T>
 *      -IEquatable<T>
 *      -IComparer<T>
 *      -Comparison<T> delegate type
 *      -Predicate<T> delegate type
 *      -Generics     
 * 
 * The primary goals of this exercise are to get you familiar with a couple of things:
 *      Unit Testing Framework (Machine.Specification)
 *      BDD Style Test Naming Syntax
 *      Fluent Assertions - You will find most of these are extension methods that start with the name Should[NAME]
 *      Refactoring
 *      Core collection interfaces and types
 *      Encapsulation
 *      
 * The main purpose of the exercise is to give you practical exposure to some fundamental design principles that will
 * become more important as the week progresses
 * 
 *      Single Responsiblity Principle
 *      Open Closed Principle
 *      Tell Don't Ask 
 *      Code to contracts not implementations
 *      Favour Composition over inheritance
 *      
 *
 * The tests are complete. You will just need to get the implementation working. 
 * 
 * 
 * ************** RESTRICTIONS **************************************************************************************
 * No linq allowed - this is to force some interesting design problems to the surface
 * You can only change the code in the following classes:
 *          - Movie
 *          - MovieLibrary
 *          
 * If you have any questions please do not hesitate to email me at jp@developwithpassion.com
 * Or give me a call at (503)213-3507
 * 
 * Develop With Passion®!!
